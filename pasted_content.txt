Terms and Conditions
The following terms and conditions apply to all sales and services provided by A-1 Affordable Plumbing Services.
Estimates
Validity: Estimates (also known as quotes or proposals) are valid for 30 days from the date of creation. While all efforts are made to guarantee the quoted price, no estimates are guaranteed until both parties sign a contract.
Price Changes: Current prices of materials, labor, plumbing codes, building codes, and other related expenses dictate estimate totals and are subject to change. If changes occur such that we can no longer perform the work at the estimated price at the time the customer is ready to sign, an updated estimate will be provided, voiding the previous one.
Contractual Agreement: A signed estimate by the customer giving A-1 Affordable Plumbing Services the approval to commence work is considered a legally binding contract.
Contracts
A-1 Affordable Plumbing Services agrees only to perform the work as written in the signed estimate, which becomes a legally binding contract upon signing.
Additional Work: Omissions in the written contract and any work requested that deviates from the contract are considered extra and are not included in the contract price. Any additional work not disclosed or reasonably anticipated will be charged in addition to the contract price. Additional work will be agreed upon separately using a Change Order, signed by the customer.
Completion Timeline: A-1 Affordable Plumbing Services will complete the entire contracted scope of work as scheduled or within 90 days of the signed estimate. Work dates are subject to change due to unforeseen circumstances and will be rescheduled in a timely manner.
Delays: The company is not responsible for delays due to circumstances such as: delays from other contractors, customer-initiated change orders, customer or site unavailability, material or supply availability, changes in codes, extreme weather, acts of God, etc. Efforts will be made to complete work to the customerâ€™s satisfaction in accordance with our satisfaction guarantee.
Guarantees
12-Month Service Work Guarantee: For the first year following completion of the contracted service, if you are not fully satisfied, please contact us. We will work to resolve the issue or refund your service call fee.
12-Month Installation Guarantee: For the first year following completion of installation work, if you are not fully satisfied, please contact us. We will work to resolve the issue or remove the installed equipment and give you a refund.
Guarantee Conditions
The guarantee only covers contracted and completed work done by us. It is void if another company or person modifies the work completed.
Acts of God or other disasters are not covered, including floods, freezing pipes, power surges, outages, etc.
Extended Warranties: Valid only if in writing and signed by A-1 Affordable Plumbing Services. We accept no liability for pre-existing equipment, materials, or parts.
Exclusions: Installed equipment comes with its own manufacturer's warranty. For replacement, repair, or modification of any product, additional labor charges may apply. These costs are the customer's responsibility. Materials or equipment not supplied by us, including those supplied by the customer, are excluded.
Deposits
Deposits are required for services where equipment or materials must be ordered prior to the job. Details on the required deposit (typically 50%) will be noted on the Estimate and are due when work begins, becoming a legally binding contract upon signing.
Payment: Deposits can be paid via cash, check, or major credit card.
Payments
Payment in Full: Due upon completion of service (less any deposits) and can be paid via cash, check, or major credit card. A-1 Affordable Plumbing Services retains full ownership of any materials/equipment until full payment is made.
Non-payment: Damages resulting from the removal of materials/equipment if payment is not completed within 30 days of completed service are not our responsibility.
Non-refundable Materials or Equipment
Occasionally, non-refundable special-order materials/equipment must be ordered. The deposit will cover all costs associated with these orders. Non-refundable special-order materials will be marked as such and are not subject to refunds.
If a contract is canceled, ownership and possession of special-order materials/equipment can be transferred to the customer.
Signature on Estimates or Invoices
By signing the contract (including all proposals, quotes, estimates, and work orders), you agree that you have read and understand these terms and conditions applicable to all contracts. No changes, cancellations, or warranties to this contract are valid without a written change order signed by both parties.
